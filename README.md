## Hereâ€™s what I did:

- Language Models as Zero-Shot Planners: Extracting Actionable Knowledge for Embodied Agents
- extracts affordances and constraints from large language models and vision-language models to compose 3D value maps, which are used by motion planners to zero-shot synthesize trajectories for everyday manipulation tasks.
- combine with e2e large model trainning framework, like UniAD;

## Execution under Disturbances

Because the language model output stays the same throughout the task, we can cache its output and re-evaluate the generated code using closed-loop visual feedback, which enables fast replanning using MPC. This enables VoxPoser to be robust to online disturbances.
